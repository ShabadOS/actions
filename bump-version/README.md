# Semantic Version Bump Action

Figures out the correct release type using the Angular [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) rules against commit history since last release.

Bumps the version of a repository according to the [project management release rules](https://github.com/shabados/.github/wiki/Project-Management#41-release-process) by bumping package.json, creating a commit, and tagging it with the bumped SemVer.

If `prerelease` is specified, the next version will be bumped to a prerelease version, with the supplied prerelease input as the id.

See the test cases to understand the bump rules, which follow SemVer, but bump from a non-prerelease to a prerelease in a manner that makes sense.

## Inputs

### `path`

**Required** The path inside the repository containing the target package.json to update. Default `"./"`.

### `prerelease`

**Required** If prerelease bump is required, supply the name of the prerelease id. Leave empty if prerelease is not required. Default `""`.

## Outputs

### `previous`

The previous semantic version.

### `next`

The next semantic version.

## Example usage

```yaml
uses: shabados/actions/bump-version@release
with:
  next: 'true'
```
